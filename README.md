# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling null values and provides a solution.

The `bug.js` file contains code that incorrectly handles null values, potentially causing unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version of the code that explicitly checks for null values before performing operations.

This example highlights the importance of robust null checks in JavaScript to prevent runtime errors and ensure the reliability of your code.
